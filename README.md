I am Casidee (Cas) and I am a Graphic Information Technologies major with a concentration in user experience.
I attend Arizona State University. After graduation, I hope to be able to use my visual arts skills along with my technical knowledge in my career.
I like playing with my dog Flea and reading. I love horror movies and strawberry cupcakes.
